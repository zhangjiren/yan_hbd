## Project Background

Used to wish happy birthday to someone special or your lover, creating a romantic atmosphere. For the story behind the project, you can read my Zhihu blog post: [Thoughts on Website Background Music from Birthday Celebrations](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/677636150)

## Usage

Fork this project, modify the customize.json file by replacing its contents with your own, then deploy it on github pages or other hosting sites (like netlify).

You can modify text, images, background music, fonts, etc., but there are some things to note:

1. Only modify the customize.json file, do not modify other files, otherwise the page may not display properly.
2. When replacing music, make sure to rename to the same music filename or modify the path in the json file, like `bgMusic.mp3` here
3. When replacing images, the birthday hat might be offset. It's recommended to crop images to the same size as the original for best viewing effect.
4. For font replacement, just modify the font configuration in json. You can use local fonts or online fonts (like Google Fonts). The project has built-in `LXGW WenKai` font file ready to use. Note that font only supports one font configuration.
  Usage example:

  ```json
    "fonts": [
      {
        "name": "Ma Shan Zheng",
        "path": "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ma+Shan+Zheng&display=swap"
      },
    //or use local font, but can only use one font at a time
    // {
    //     "name": "LXGW WenKai",
    //     "path":"./fonts/LXGWWenKai-Regular.ttf"
    //   } 
    ]
  ```

## Local Development/Preview

The project uses npm as package manager. Make sure you have node environment configured locally, otherwise please install it yourself. Verify node environment as follows:

```
$ node -v
v22.2.1
```

Then install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run:

```
npm run start
```

## Others

The overall implementation uses pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, along with GSAP for animations.
